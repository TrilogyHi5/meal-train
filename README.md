  # <Meal-Train>
 
  ## Description
  
  Useful app for anyone who needs to create specialized meal plans for dietary restrictions or based on select dietary interests.
  
  The motivation for our final project was to create a useful application that could be fulfill the need for a service people may want to use, and continue to utilize because it fulfills their needs and it is accessible to them.

  Dietary needs are always on trend because people are always looking to get fit or eat healthier. This application has in mind those users that want to improve their diets and eating habits, but that definitely need guidance and convenience in order to achieve it.
  
  Our application aids to guide, and provide convenience by providing a service that is easy to use and brings options to the table for a wide variety of selections, interests, and needs.

  Creating this application has it's share of challenges. The main being fetching the API and making sure we captured the data that we wanted. Although our API has a descriptive documentation is was still challenging to use due its low amount of free calls per month. However, we decided to stick to our idea because we believed it was worth developing. This application has potential to continue to grow and be implemented in so many ways, that is what makes this a pssion project because it is something we can continue to grow and implement. Deployment on Heroku is a challenge within itself for many of our projects. So it is key to move slow, and deploy in smaller blocks of code at a time so it is easier to debug. The challenges teach us to be resourceful, ask the right questions, look at the code and documentation thoroughly, and most of all to learn to take everything is stride.
